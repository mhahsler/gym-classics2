    v1 follows the textbook and does not end episodes when the cliff is reached. Also, the goal is 
    a real state.

    **reference:** cite{3} (page 132, example 6.6).

    **state**: Grid location.

    **actions**: Move up/right/down/left.

    **rewards**: -100 for entering The Cliff. -1 for all other transitions.

    **termination**: reaching the goal.
