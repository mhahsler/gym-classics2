    are noisy; with a 10% chance each, a move action may be rotated by 90 degrees
    clockwise or counter-clockwise (the "80-10-10 rule"). Cell (1, 1) is blocked and
    cannot be occupied by the agent.

    **reference:** cite{1} (page 646).

    **state**: Grid location.

    **actions**: Move up/right/down/left.

    **rewards**: +1 for taking any action in cell (3, 2). -1 for taking any
    action in cell (3, 1). *NOTE:*  v1 uses the original -0.04 penalty for each state.

    **termination**: Earning a nonzero reward.
